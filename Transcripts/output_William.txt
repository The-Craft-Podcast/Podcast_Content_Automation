Segment 39:

Segment 40:
Start time: 167.32
End time: 168.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the one was my neighbor.

Segment 41:
Start time: 170.06
End time: 171.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I learned to speak late in life.

Segment 42:
Start time: 172.20
End time: 174.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like I was about four until I started really talking.

Segment 43:
Start time: 177.44
End time: 181.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And before then it was just words or in clips and phrases.

Segment 44:
Start time: 181.36
End time: 183.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's when I really started going at it.

Segment 45:
Start time: 183.96
End time: 187.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it wasn't very far after that until I started doing BASIC.

Segment 46:
Start time: 188.06
End time: 192.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my neighbor had this, I guess I should hunt down.

Segment 47:
Start time: 192.76
End time: 194.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  BASIC, the programming language.

Segment 48:
Start time: 194.58
End time: 194.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Segment 49:
Start time: 195.36
End time: 196.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 50:
Start time: 196.36
End time: 201.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you have to call it a computer, but it runs off of a cassette tape.

Segment 51:
Start time: 201.94
End time: 203.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there were, I think there were two cassette tapes in there.

Segment 52:
Start time: 203.96
End time: 207.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like you would pop in a cassette tape, you would turn it on and it would run BASIC.

Segment 53:
Start time: 207.88
End time: 208.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all it would do.

Segment 54:
Start time: 209.10
End time: 214.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And for history, I should really get one of these, but I guess my English to BASIC, like

Segment 55:
Start time: 214.26
End time: 215.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the English started late, the BASIC started early.

Segment 56:
Start time: 216.34
End time: 223.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that was, you know, that was one sign is that I was here to learn, to study, to program,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  50.

Segment 112:
Start time: 374.26
End time: 375.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So two weeks here, two weeks there, my whole life.

Segment 113:
Start time: 377.04
End time: 382.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that really gave me the perspective of like listening to one person and then not

Segment 114:
Start time: 382.96
End time: 384.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  listening to that person for a while.

Segment 115:
Start time: 385.08
End time: 386.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got that really early in life.

Segment 116:
Start time: 386.88
End time: 388.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But as an adult, you really pick up on that.

Segment 117:
Start time: 388.60
End time: 392.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like as a, you know, there's the child learning phase and there's adult learning

Segment 118:
Start time: 392.86
End time: 393.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  phase.

Segment 119:
Start time: 393.84
End time: 396.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And as a child, you're supposed to like listen to your parents all the time until you realize

Segment 120:
Start time: 396.36
End time: 397.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that you know more than them.

Segment 121:
Start time: 397.72
End time: 399.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you become an adult.

Segment 122:
Start time: 399.22
End time: 400.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's whenever that happens.

Segment 123:
Start time: 401.04
End time: 406.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But as a child, I learned that there's a lot of perspective because I didn't have, and

Segment 124:
Start time: 407.08
End time: 410.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  also I didn't have this thing like some kids who have parents that are split, they, you

Segment 125:
Start time: 410.02
End time: 412.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know, they're, they're with the one parent most of the time, except for the token amount

Segment 126:
Start time: 412.64
End time: 413.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and the other time I didn't have that.

Segment 127:
Start time: 413.74
End time: 414.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was 50 50 the whole way.

Segment 128:
Start time: 415.88
End time: 422.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And really just flipping and flopping on these perspectives really gave me a lot to start

Segment 129:
Start time: 422.58
End time: 423.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with in life.

Segment 130:
Start time: 424.14
End time: 427.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I always came in, I wasn't on the punk scene, but I was definitely, and I wasn't

Segment 131:
Start time: 427.68
End time: 432.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on the anarchist scene, but I definitely had the cookbook and I definitely had all the

Segment 132:
Start time: 432.38
End time: 435.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  things that, you know, these two, I went to the, I was on these scenes, right?

Segment 133:
Start time: 435.78
End time: 441.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not admitting to anything that anarchists do, but I'm definitely from a lot of perspectives

Segment 134:
Start time: 442.50
End time: 445.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  from childhood, something that people don't usually get into adulthood.

Segment 135:
Start time: 446.38
End time: 451.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so from there, I learned that you can really question what people are telling you

Segment 136:
Start time: 452.06
End time: 454.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and you really have to make for yourself.

Segment 137:
Start time: 454.36
End time: 455.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You make the ideas in your head.

Segment 138:
Start time: 455.56
End time: 459.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the ideas, the influences come from the outside, but the ideas come from within.

Segment 139:
Start time: 460.22
End time: 463.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the ideas can manifest through your hands into the world.

Segment 140:
Start time: 464.34
End time: 467.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's something I learned earlier than a lot of people.

Segment 141:
Start time: 469.12
End time: 476.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so really, you know, if I'm a master of something, then it's building or it's open

Segment 142:
Start time: 476.14
End time: 476.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  source.

Segment 143:
Start time: 477.04
End time: 481.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's what that's later in life, but just the understanding that you can make

Segment 144:
Start time: 481.42
End time: 485.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  things, that's the powerful thing that not everybody gets in life.

Segment 145:
Start time: 487.53
End time: 487.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Segment 146:
Start time: 487.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Segment 147:
Start time: 489.12
End time: 494.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And as you got older, so you were, you were tinkering with these things at some point,

Segment 148:
Start time: 494.84
End time: 496.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you must've discovered the internet.

Segment 149:
Start time: 497.50
End time: 497.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.

Segment 150:
Start time: 497.56
End time: 498.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Through the modem.

Segment 151:
Start time: 498.68
End time: 499.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was that like?

Segment 152:
Start time: 500.21
End time: 500.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Segment 153:
Start time: 500.82
End time: 501.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So BBS.

Segment 154:
Start time: 501.68
End time: 505.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So back then, so my first connection with the internet was through modems.

Segment 155:
Start time: 506.04
End time: 509.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you would, this is in the nineties.

Segment 156:
Start time: 509.68
End time: 512.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you would get the modem, but then like a few weeks later, you have to get the next

Segment 157:
Start time: 512.28
End time: 514.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  modem because they were just getting better constantly.

Segment 158:
Start time: 516.32
End time: 518.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I got the modems and then you would have to dial into things.

Segment 159:
Start time: 518.88
End time: 523.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So those were the BBSs, which I guess are basically like discords right now.

Segment 160:
Start time: 524.45
End time: 524.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Segment 161:
Start time: 524.80
End time: 527.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Same exact thing, but you'd have to dial, you dial into them.

Segment 162:
Start time: 527.76
End time: 530.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are phone numbers attached and identically the same thing.

Segment 163:
Start time: 531.32
End time: 534.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're all based on the same concept, decades and decades of the same idea.

Segment 164:
Start time: 534.62
End time: 537.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're dialing and you would trade files or talk to people.

Segment 165:
Start time: 538.52
End time: 544.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I had pen pals when I was, you know, nine years old or under, you know, pen pals

Segment 166:
Start time: 544.68
End time: 545.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that my parents didn't know about.

Segment 167:
Start time: 546.52
End time: 552.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I guess that is the pen pals were different back then because you had less of them and

Segment 168:
Start time: 552.56
End time: 553.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they weren't people screaming at you.

Segment 169:
Start time: 553.88
End time: 555.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There were people that wanted to talk to you.

Segment 170:
Start time: 555.90
End time: 556.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Segment 171:
Start time: 556.92
End time: 558.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it was private conversations.

Segment 172:
Start time: 558.44
End time: 562.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now if you can say that people have pen pals, they are with random people that don't care

Segment 173:
Start time: 562.72
End time: 564.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about you and are very likely robots.

Segment 174:
Start time: 565.95
End time: 566.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Segment 175:
Start time: 566.86
End time: 567.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that was my beginning.

Segment 176:
Start time: 570.14
End time: 571.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Segment 177:
Start time: 571.68
End time: 576.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then, so eventually, of course, you have to kind of make some decisions about what

Segment 178:
Start time: 577.92
End time: 579.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to study and what to do.

Segment 179:
Start time: 581.95
End time: 583.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was that like going through college?

Segment 180:
Start time: 583.70
End time: 588.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then you did graduate school, which was actually where, where we met at Drexel back

Segment 181:
Start time: 588.78
End time: 590.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  many years ago in Philadelphia.

Segment 182:
Start time: 591.47
End time: 591.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Segment 183:
Start time: 591.88
End time: 594.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was in, I learned about Linux in high school.

Segment 184:
Start time: 594.60
End time: 595.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was interesting.

Segment 185:
Start time: 595.92
End time: 598.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's my beginning, my open source life.

Segment 186:
Start time: 599.78
End time: 605.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then I decided to get into electrical and computer engineering and math for undergrad.

Segment 187:
Start time: 606.52
End time: 609.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was, that was the, that was the idea I had in my head.

Segment 188:
Start time: 610.50
End time: 615.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought that engineering was hard to get into and that it was more of a, more of a

Segment 189:
Start time: 615.52
End time: 619.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  real, a real study versus some of the other things that are offered out there.

Segment 190:
Start time: 620.44
End time: 624.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is before we used the word STEM, you know, back then everybody was equal and wonderful

Segment 191:
Start time: 624.52
End time: 625.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  who went to school.

Segment 192:
Start time: 625.64
End time: 627.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now you're only cool if you do STEM, apparently.

Segment 193:
Start time: 628.64
End time: 629.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're changing that to STEAM.

Segment 194:
Start time: 630.12
End time: 631.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But back then I decided engineering is going to be tough.

Segment 195:
Start time: 632.28
End time: 634.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if I could study, then I can, I can do that.

Segment 196:
Start time: 635.22
End time: 636.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's how I got into undergrad.

Segment 197:
Start time: 637.12
End time: 641.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also worked at the Department of Defense and I worked at Google during that time for

Segment 198:
Start time: 641.14
End time: 641.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a little bit.

Segment 199:
Start time: 642.14
End time: 643.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So those are some of the experiences.

Segment 200:
Start time: 643.70
End time: 647.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So school, work and government were all in my head.

Segment 201:
Start time: 648.54
End time: 649.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I didn't like Google.

Segment 202:
Start time: 650.60
End time: 655.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't like, I didn't like it there back in the O's because nobody there was over 30.

Segment 203:
Start time: 657.02
End time: 661.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I realized that, and at the time I realized that they only really had one product that

Segment 204:
Start time: 661.20
End time: 662.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ever worked, which was ads.

Segment 205:
Start time: 663.80
End time: 666.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And since then they've yet to launch another product that really makes money.

Segment 206:
Start time: 667.26
End time: 672.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I thought this is a company, and this is me as a kid, I thought this is a company that

Segment 207:
Start time: 673.48
End time: 675.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  fails to deliver new products and doesn't hire people over 30.

Segment 208:
Start time: 676.22
End time: 679.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, this is probably not going to be, you know, it'll be fun, but I'm not going

Segment 209:
Start time: 679.48
End time: 684.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to learn as much as the hype gave you.

Segment 210:
Start time: 684.56
End time: 688.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also worked in the government and that was also in engineering.

Segment 211:
Start time: 688.52
End time: 693.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got an opportunity to go to one of the three-letter agencies and that was going to be my career

Segment 212:
Start time: 694.42
End time: 695.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to do that type of stuff.

Segment 213:
Start time: 696.84
End time: 700.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Failed the polygraph miserably, just multiple times, multiple hours.

Segment 214:
Start time: 702.36
End time: 708.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I will finally come forward with that story at some point, but basically I am no longer

Segment 215:
Start time: 708.56
End time: 712.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  able to work at the three-letter agencies because of this, or that's at least my understanding.

Segment 216:
Start time: 713.02
End time: 719.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I thought, okay, well that's really like the best engineering job you can get is where

Segment 217:
Start time: 719.06
End time: 724.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was in those two places on earth, like at Google or these three other agencies.

Segment 218:
Start time: 724.54
End time: 729.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I was like, okay, well engineering, I need to diversify my portfolio here because

Segment 219:
Start time: 730.08
End time: 734.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not going to become world-class as an engineer if these two avenues suck.

Segment 220:
Start time: 734.92
End time: 736.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then for grad school, I went to business.

Segment 221:
Start time: 736.82
End time: 741.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I went for finance, international business, and that really opened a lot of doors too.

Segment 222:
Start time: 742.94
End time: 748.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So under my undergrad definition, that was a soft major, that was a real soft one.

Segment 223:
Start time: 749.02
End time: 752.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I was working at the time so I could work in school, obviously didn't require my full

Segment 224:
Start time: 753.00
End time: 756.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  attention for grad school, but that's how I got into business.

Segment 225:
Start time: 757.34
End time: 757.40
Speaker: Unknown
Transcript:  Wow.

Segment 226:
Start time: 758.81
End time: 759.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Segment 227:
Start time: 760.30
End time: 766.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I guess it was maybe around that time that you started keeping these annual goals,

Segment 228:
Start time: 766.69
End time: 766.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right?

Segment 229:
Start time: 767.34
End time: 771.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you still, you have this list of annual goals you put publicly on your website.

Segment 230:
Start time: 771.74
End time: 773.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've been updating them every year since 2011.

Segment 231:
Start time: 775.50
End time: 777.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How did that practice start?

Segment 232:
Start time: 778.34
End time: 784.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I guess it wraps into kind of just how you think about setting goals in life

Segment 233:
Start time: 784.72
End time: 791.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and deciding how to spend your time if the so-called two great avenues for engineers

Segment 234:
Start time: 793.95
End time: 795.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  isn't the road to paradise.

Segment 235:
Start time: 796.36
End time: 798.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is something I started in grad school.

Segment 236:
Start time: 798.80
End time: 803.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the book was, I think the book's called 168 Hours or something like that.

Segment 237:
Start time: 803.92
End time: 806.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's possibly what got me onto this.

Segment 238:
Start time: 807.30
End time: 812.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what I did was, because college is just, grad school was just such a crazy time for

Segment 239:
Start time: 812.38
End time: 816.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  me, school and work and lots of changes in life and moving and all that.

Segment 240:
Start time: 817.06
End time: 823.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what I did was, is I took a snapshot of my week and I mapped out my 168 hours and

Segment 241:
Start time: 825.24
End time: 829.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  then I snapshot it like the year before or something and I compared them and I did a

Segment 242:
Start time: 830.20
End time: 830.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  diff.

Segment 243:
Start time: 831.14
End time: 833.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said, I did more hours on this and less hours on that.

Segment 244:
Start time: 834.38
End time: 839.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I thought, where is, which of these things are having impacts on routines?

Segment 245:
Start time: 839.18
End time: 842.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For me, if you're not doing it weekly, if you're not writing it down and telling everybody,

Segment 246:
Start time: 843.02
End time: 843.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you're not doing it all.

Segment 247:
Start time: 844.62
End time: 851.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if your podcast isn't weekly, if your workout routine isn't, I mean, it can be more than

Segment 248:
Start time: 851.22
End time: 855.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  weekly, but it has to at least be on a weekly schedule, then that's where habits come from.

Segment 249:
Start time: 855.58
End time: 856.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I figured that out.

Segment 250:
Start time: 856.82
End time: 859.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so when I found, I started with my time.

Segment 251:
Start time: 860.06
End time: 863.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I found my time, I said, okay, all the things I'm going to achieve are either

Segment 252:
Start time: 863.20
End time: 867.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going to be fitting into my week or if they're not going to fit into my week, they need to

Segment 253:
Start time: 867.64
End time: 869.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  be so big that they don't fit.

Segment 254:
Start time: 869.74
End time: 874.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the problem is when you make big goals like that, it's easy to push them off because

Segment 255:
Start time: 874.56
End time: 876.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if it's not this week, it's next week and next week never comes.

Segment 256:
Start time: 877.80
End time: 881.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So for my bigger goals, I actually just started writing them down and publishing them.

Segment 257:
Start time: 881.82
End time: 886.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so those are on my website and there's, I mean, there's big things, there's little

Segment 258:
Start time: 886.80
End time: 886.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  things.

Segment 259:
Start time: 888.60
End time: 892.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the, I mean, there's all kinds of good stuff here, but if you don't write it down,

Segment 260:
Start time: 892.78
End time: 893.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  then it doesn't happen.

Segment 261:
Start time: 894.08
End time: 897.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also have a book, I always have this book with me.

Segment 262:
Start time: 898.10
End time: 901.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's the famous book, you know, important meetings going here.

Segment 263:
Start time: 902.00
End time: 903.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I even write commitments to myself in here.

Segment 264:
Start time: 904.20
End time: 906.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So like, what am I going to do this month or something?

Segment 265:
Start time: 907.38
End time: 909.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not just because they're private.

Segment 266:
Start time: 909.80
End time: 911.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not like I only put the private things in the book.

Segment 267:
Start time: 912.00
End time: 915.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just that I didn't feel like they were important enough to publish yet.

Segment 268:
Start time: 916.54
End time: 917.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, you got to make commitments.

Segment 269:
Start time: 918.42
End time: 919.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where big things happen from.

Segment 270:
Start time: 921.58
End time: 921.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Segment 271:
Start time: 926.52
End time: 926.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And 168 hours.

Segment 272:
Start time: 928.80
End time: 929.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the, that's a book.

Segment 273:
Start time: 930.04
End time: 934.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You also keep track of all the books you read and you have like little reviews.

Segment 274:
Start time: 935.38
End time: 935.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't everybody.

Segment 275:
Start time: 936.70
End time: 937.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that not a thing?

Segment 276:
Start time: 938.40
End time: 940.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it should be.

Segment 277:
Start time: 941.34
End time: 945.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's great to see like your, your reflections on the books.

Segment 278:
Start time: 946.60
End time: 951.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've decided not to read a bunch of books just because you gave them a poor review.

Segment 279:
Start time: 953.06
End time: 955.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I don't encapsulated like they're 300 pages into one sentence.

Segment 280:
Start time: 959.41
End time: 960.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But maybe you really resonate.

Segment 281:
Start time: 960.60
End time: 962.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I, I don't really like star ratings.

Segment 282:
Start time: 962.54
End time: 963.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think star ratings are going away.

Segment 283:
Start time: 964.16
End time: 970.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I try to put like the words sometimes I really, there's just nothing redeeming to say about a book.

Segment 284:
Start time: 970.70
End time: 973.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But in general, for me, if you don't have a pen, you can't read.

Segment 285:
Start time: 975.72
End time: 977.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's got to be interactive.

Segment 286:
Start time: 977.56
End time: 978.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 1029.62
End time: 1038.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Segment 304:
Start time: 1038.68
End time: 1043.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And maybe we could try and take the example of when you first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Segment 309:
Start time: 1053.78
End time: 1054.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 310:
Start time: 1055.64
End time: 1057.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Learning is for suckers doing is for winners.

Segment 311:
Start time: 1059.16
End time: 1063.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 312:
Start time: 1065.68
End time: 1067.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember this discussion forever ago.

Segment 313:
Start time: 1068.16
End time: 1071.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I was like, Dan, I'm learning Chinese.

Segment 314:
Start time: 1071.68
End time: 1075.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I started doing this podcast or something, but I'm stuck.

Segment 315:
Start time: 1076.18
End time: 1078.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm stuck between the beginner lessons and the intermediate lessons.

Segment 316:
Start time: 1078.60
End time: 1079.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The beginner ones are too easy.

Segment 317:
Start time: 1079.66
End time: 1081.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The intermediate is too hard.

Segment 318:
Start time: 1081.68
End time: 1082.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 319:
Start time: 1082.54
End time: 1084.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And do you remember what you said?

Segment 320:
Start time: 1087.02
End time: 1090.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Segment 321:
Start time: 1091.46
End time: 1093.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, go to the advanced ones.

Segment 322:
Start time: 1095.86
End time: 1097.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly what I did.

Segment 323:
Start time: 1102.41
End time: 1104.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the progressive learning, this is all done.

Segment 324:
Start time: 1105.28
End time: 1108.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The progressive learning is not how you learn.

Segment 325:
Start time: 1109.13
End time: 1110.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is how kids learn.

Segment 326:
Start time: 1111.04
End time: 1114.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And maybe, maybe that's for kids, but the adult learning, the way you learn as an adult is you do things.

Segment 327:
Start time: 1115.78
End time: 1121.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so for programming and for technology, the answer is you must, every time have a project.

Segment 328:
Start time: 1123.45
End time: 1124.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A full MVP.

Segment 329:
Start time: 1124.54
End time: 1125.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm the master of MVP.

Segment 330:
Start time: 1125.56
End time: 1126.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's another thing.

Segment 331:
Start time: 1127.28
End time: 1130.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So MVP, the MVP of learning is producing.

Segment 332:
Start time: 1133.24
End time: 1135.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there is no learning for learning sake.

Segment 333:
Start time: 1135.92
End time: 1137.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People don't learn things unless you're a kid.

Segment 334:
Start time: 1137.72
End time: 1139.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And kids learn auditorily.

Segment 335:
Start time: 1140.02
End time: 1143.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they learn because they like to repeat things through their mouth that they hear through their ears.

Segment 336:
Start time: 1143.54
End time: 1144.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kids are different.

Segment 337:
Start time: 1145.54
End time: 1151.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But as an adult, after 12 or something, you learn with the goal of an outcome.

Segment 338:
Start time: 1152.66
End time: 1157.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so for technology and things in life, I immediately start with I want to make.

Segment 339:
Start time: 1158.68
End time: 1166.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if the goal is I want to learn how to solder, the answer is not I want to solder things onto a board.

Segment 340:
Start time: 1166.54
End time: 1167.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The answer is I want to make.

Segment 341:
Start time: 1167.58
End time: 1172.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 342:
Start time: 1173.66
End time: 1176.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 343:
Start time: 1176.80
End time: 1177.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of these is for me.

Segment 344:
Start time: 1178.60
End time: 1180.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is surface mount practice.

Segment 345:
Start time: 1180.54
End time: 1181.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this one's for me.

Segment 346:
Start time: 1181.98
End time: 1183.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's because I haven't soldered in a year or something.

Segment 347:
Start time: 1184.56
End time: 1185.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm going to practice on this before I work with her.

Segment 348:
Start time: 1186.66
End time: 1189.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then hers is not I'm going to learn how to solder.

Segment 349:
Start time: 1189.54
End time: 1190.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's I'm going to make a radio.

Segment 350:
Start time: 1192.64
End time: 1195.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 351:
Start time: 1196.24
End time: 1199.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 352:
Start time: 1199.83
End time: 1200.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 353:
Start time: 1201.22
End time: 1205.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 354:
Start time: 1205.58
End time: 1207.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 355:
Start time: 1210.53
End time: 1211.06

Segment 356:
Start time: 1211.54
End time: 1212.52

Segment 357:
Start time: 1213.36
End time: 1218.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 358:
Start time: 1219.18
End time: 1221.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But when I decided that I was going to do NFTs.

Segment 359:
Start time: 1224.28
End time: 1231.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thought was, I mean, I saw the opportunity of how to get into NFTs and I saw where I didn't fit in, which was the standardization process.

Segment 360:
Start time: 1232.62
End time: 1235.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But in order to do that, the goal was never to standardize or to learn.

Segment 361:
Start time: 1235.54
End time: 1238.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was I need to build I need to get right into the making.

Segment 362:
Start time: 1239.90
End time: 1244.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I made my own NFT project as a demo for the future.

Segment 363:
Start time: 1246.93
End time: 1248.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really, for me, for the future, me and building things.

Segment 364:
Start time: 1248.82
End time: 1251.54

Segment 365:
Start time: 1252.34
End time: 1258.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I decided that I needed to learn Ethereum, blockchain, smart contracts, NFTs, this type of stuff.

Segment 366:
Start time: 1258.54
End time: 1259.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I went on Upwork.

End time: 1544.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  And to a Chinese person for reasons.

Segment 481:
Start time: 1579.78
End time: 1585.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I'm saying, like, don't just say because you showed up here is that's why you won.

Segment 482:
Start time: 1587.20
End time: 1587.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Segment 483:
Start time: 1587.83

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Segment 490:
Start time: 1600.54
End time: 1603.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could have just went and found a bunch of other Chinese students and.

Segment 491:
Start time: 1606.07
End time: 1606.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Segment 492:
Start time: 1606.37
End time: 1607.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript: But that would be too sad for me.

Segment 493:
Start time: 1607.54
End time: 1608.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, come in every day.

Segment 494:
Start time: 1608.47
End time: 1609.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Segment 495:
Start time: 1610.92

Transcript:  No, I mean, that would be like, yes.

Segment 496:
Start time: 1613.43
End time: 1617.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript: So I wanted to, you know, it's a more I wanted to know, like, their life.

Segment 497:
Start time: 1618.54
End time: 1619.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's so different at the time.

Segment 498:
Start time: 1619.67
End time: 1621.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript: I was really curious.

Segment 499:
Start time: 1621.72
End time: 1626.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then and then I was like, I wanted to join their conversation instead of just sit in my room.

Segment 500:
Start time: 1628.08
End time: 1633.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I know a lot of friends that, you know, they kind of afraid, you know, of of new environment.

Segment 501:
Start time: 1633.64
End time: 1639.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then so so they just, you know, kind of have this habit, not talking too much sometimes.

Segment 502:
Start time: 1640.30
End time: 1644.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And which I think is really bad for themselves, like for their personal involvement.

Segment 503:
Start time: 1644.56
End time: 1645.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Segment 504:
Start time: 1645.18
End time: 1649.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript: Yeah.

Segment 505:
Start time: 1649.81
End time: 1651.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript: Right.

Segment 506:
Start time: 1651.08
End time: 1652.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript: So maybe less like after.

Segment 507:
Start time: 1654.14
End time: 1661.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So since you introduced like the learning process of getting to know blockchain and you learn that really fast,

Segment 508:
Start time: 1662.38
End time: 1665.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  like you came out with the ERC 721, which is so groundbreaking.

Segment 509:
Start time: 1666.96
End time: 1678.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'm actually really curious about like the process of, you know, how do you what kind of consideration that went into it when you're trying to build the FT standards?

Segment 510:
Start time: 1678.78
End time: 1686.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And did you know at the time that this will be like such a having such a big impact and it becomes so popular afterwards?

Segment 511:
Start time: 1687.12
End time: 1689.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you want to talk more about that?

Segment 512:
Start time: 1689.90
End time: 1690.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript: Yeah.

Segment 513:
Start time: 1690.86
End time: 1691.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Segment 514:
Start time: 1691.22
End time: 1694.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: So, yes, I did expect this would be this big.

Segment 515:
Start time: 1694.68
End time: 1704.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I expect it to be bigger in different ways, in boring ways, not like money ways or getting rich ways, just pervasive pervasiveness.

Segment 516:
Start time: 1705.96
End time: 1708.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's my vision for NFT is pretty expensive.

Segment 517:
Start time: 1708.98
End time: 1711.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's going to change commerce, you know, wholly.

Segment 518:
Start time: 1713.62
End time: 1716.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But in ways that people don't even notice, which is fine.

Segment 519:
Start time: 1717.04
End time: 1718.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so that was that was what I thought about it coming in.

Segment 520:
Start time: 1719.54
End time: 1721.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The process, the paper itself.

Segment 521:
Start time: 1721.60
End time: 1728.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we're talking about this paper called ERC 721, which is the specification for NFTs on blockchain.

Segment 522:
Start time: 1729.74
End time: 1735.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can actually do NFTs without blockchain, but these are the ones that are on blockchain, which is mostly where people recognize them.

Segment 523:
Start time: 1736.54
End time: 1741.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so my contribution academically here is to help write this paper.

Segment 524:
Start time: 1741.54
End time: 1742.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm the lead author of this paper.

Segment 525:
Start time: 1742.27
End time: 1742.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: We have four authors.

Segment 526:
Start time: 1743.54
End time: 1747.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the paper just explains technically, how do you do this on Ethereum?

Segment 527:
Start time: 1747.54
End time: 1749.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then there's a lot of explanation on why we made these choices.

Segment 528:
Start time: 1750.70
End time: 1752.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, that's the paper.

Segment 529:
Start time: 1752.53
End time: 1754.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: The paper is it's OK.

Segment 530:
Start time: 1754.58
End time: 1759.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, if I could if I could write it again by myself, I would have, you know, there's things I would do differently.

Segment 531:
Start time: 1759.84
End time: 1762.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not it's not perfect and there's not going to be a version two.

Segment 532:
Start time: 1763.16
End time: 1768.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reason why is because the whole point of this paper is to make everybody agree on the specification.

Segment 533:
Start time: 1768.80
End time: 1775.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the cool thing about this paper is that there is not a competing one and that people that want to do this thing are all compatible.

Segment 534:
Start time: 1776.27
End time: 1778.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you're making one of these things, I'm making one.

Segment 535:
Start time: 1778.94
End time: 1782.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can both be traded with each other using compatible software.

Segment 536:
Start time: 1782.74
End time: 1786.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are called marketplaces or places that you buy and sell NFTs.

Segment 537:
Start time: 1786.86
End time: 1791.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So really, the process here was a little bit technical, like making it work and testing.

Segment 538:
Start time: 1791.64
End time: 1794.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was that was half of it.

Segment 539:
Start time: 1794.09
End time: 1795.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: The other half was entirely political.

Segment 540:
Start time: 1796.60
End time: 1805.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Getting people to agree and to adopt this, this is the only standard, I believe, on Ethereum at the time or maybe still that was accepted unanimously.

Segment 541:
Start time: 1806.26
End time: 1807.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So everybody agreed.

Segment 542:
Start time: 1807.59
End time: 1811.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: So everybody who participated agreed that this was the way forward for this.

Segment 543:
Start time: 1811.80
End time: 1818.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was the accomplishment, because if you want things to be compatible, you don't want somebody forking you or stepping aside with a competing standard.

Segment 544:
Start time: 1819.24
End time: 1823.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the process here, the way that I learned and the way that I did this, I did a couple of things.

Segment 545:
Start time: 1825.72
End time: 1828.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody was here and they wanted this to proceed.

Segment 546:
Start time: 1828.39
End time: 1830.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: Everybody wanted NFTs in this space.

Segment 547:
Start time: 1831.54
End time: 1836.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody in this space of developers with Ethereum making blockchain stuff.

Segment 548:
Start time: 1838.33
End time: 1841.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the scene that I was in, they wanted a path forward for NFTs.

Segment 549:
Start time: 1842.30
End time: 1843.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're not seeing my hands.

Segment 550:
Start time: 1843.19
End time: 1844.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: I'm nearly getting hit the conversation area.

Segment 551:
Start time: 1847.53
End time: 1850.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So everybody was here and they agreed that they wanted a path forward.

Segment 552:
Start time: 1851.40
End time: 1858.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Problem was this process was moving too slowly and some people were embarrassed to talk because they were new here.

Segment 553:
Start time: 1859.40
End time: 1861.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is this is the pitch I gave.

Segment 554:
Start time: 1861.15
End time: 1865.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: They went from not knowing anything in the scene to being in the middle of NFTs.

Segment 555:
Start time: 1866.22
End time: 1866.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's my pitch.

Segment 556:
Start time: 1866.93
End time: 1869.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: I said, my pitch is I'm going to iterate quickly on this.

Segment 557:
Start time: 1869.54
End time: 1872.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to make new drafts every time there's an improvement.

Segment 558:
Start time: 1873.28
End time: 1877.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we're going to get to the goal as fast as possible because we're going to keep iterating.

Segment 559:
Start time: 1878.36
End time: 1879.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I have a lot of time for this.

Segment 560:
Start time: 1879.75
End time: 1880.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 561:
Start time: 1880.53
End time: 1882.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 566:
Start time: 1901.82
End time: 1905.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 567:
Start time: 1906.04
End time: 1907.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're not sharing their ideas.

Segment 568:

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 571:
Start time: 1924.58
End time: 1931.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 1935.54
End time: 1944.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 575:
Start time: 1945.06
End time: 1947.51

Segment 576:
Start time: 1947.51
End time: 1954.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 577:
Start time: 1956.60
End time: 1960.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 578:
Start time: 1961.62
End time: 1962.46

Segment 582:
Start time: 1977.54

End time: 2067.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Segment 596:
Start time: 2067.86
End time: 2078.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Segment 597:
Start time: 2079.12
End time: 2087.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Segment 606:

Segment 607:
Start time: 2143.37
End time: 2148.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 611:
Start time: 2158.23
End time: 2164.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: That includes checking the contents of things, verifying, you know, if you buy something and it says, oh, this is carbon neutral.

Segment 612:
Start time: 2166.04
End time: 2167.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 613:
Start time: 2167.34
End time: 2169.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: This is carbon neutral.

Segment 614:
Start time: 2169.41
End time: 2171.03

Segment 615:
Start time: 2171.03
End time: 2171.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: This is just one example.

Segment 616:
Start time: 2171.97

Segment 618:
Start time: 2176.51
End time: 2181.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 619:
Start time: 2182.94
End time: 2185.02

Segment 622:
Start time: 2197.32
End time: 2198.54

Segment 623:

End time: 2212.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 624:
Start time: 2212.41
End time: 2216.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: Certification should be third party.

Segment 628:
Start time: 2224.14
End time: 2228.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when you buy stuff, the certifications should be verifiable.

Segment 629:
Start time: 2228.37
End time: 2231.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: This whole process of verifying things ties directly into NFTs.

Segment 630:

Segment 635:
Start time: 2259.17
End time: 2274.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript: But they kind of like embracing the concept of trying to, you know, just get verified directly from the source and to have that, you know, so you're more safe and having more security on what you kind of buy and purchase.

Segment 636:
Start time: 2274.70
End time: 2278.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 642:
Start time: 2301.60
End time: 2304.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 643:
Start time: 2304.68
End time: 2311.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 644:
Start time: 2311.05
End time: 2313.51

Segment 707:
Start time: 2582.93
End time: 2587.88

Segment 721:
Start time: 2633.19
End time: 2642.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 722:
Start time: 2642.84
End time: 2644.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 723:
Start time: 2644.62
End time: 2645.54

Segment 724:
Start time: 2646.46
End time: 2650.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 725:

Segment 733:
Start time: 2659.96
End time: 2661.54

Segment 734:
Start time: 2664.42
End time: 2667.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 735:
Start time: 2667.12
End time: 2668.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: That's the whole point.

Segment 736:
Start time: 2668.49
End time: 2671.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 737:

Segment 738:
Start time: 2672.09
End time: 2677.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 739:
Start time: 2677.26
End time: 2682.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: It's like when you learn religion, they say the whole point of, I don't know if this is a Jewish quote or something, but it's the whole point of religion is love.

Start time: 2682.54
End time: 2686.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every religion.

Segment 742:
Start time: 2690.78
End time: 2698.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 743:
Start time: 2698.53
End time: 2699.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 744:
Start time: 2699.91
End time: 2705.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 2712.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 750:
Start time: 2721.03
End time: 2727.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 751:
Start time: 2727.19
End time: 2731.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 752:
Start time: 2731.04
End time: 2731.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: And it's fast.

Segment 753:
Start time: 2732.92
End time: 2737.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 754:
Start time: 2737.72
End time: 2738.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 755:
Start time: 2738.47
End time: 2740.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: You don't have to be in a journal to do science.

Segment 756:
Start time: 2740.35
End time: 2742.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: You just have to follow this process.

Segment 757:
Start time: 2742.51
End time: 2743.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: And this is science.

Segment 758:
Start time: 2743.31
End time: 2750.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: So for me, the understanding of science was getting this one line of code fix in the Linux kernel.

Segment 759:
Start time: 2750.54
End time: 2753.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: And then I took this experience forward for everything with open source.

Segment 760:
Start time: 2755.98
End time: 2757.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Segment 761:
Start time: 2757.04
End time: 2761.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Segment 762:
Start time: 2761.15
End time: 2763.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript: What is the process like today?

Segment 763:
Start time: 2763.65
End time: 2772.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript: I mean, I guess that that general loop is the same, but the I'm sure like things have evolved.

Segment 764:
Start time: 2772.78
End time: 2777.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Segment 765:
Start time: 2778.86
End time: 2785.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a lot of kind of norms and complexities that have popped up.

Segment 766:
Start time: 2786.54
End time: 2790.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think very little has changed since decades ago of open source.

Segment 767:
Start time: 2790.46
End time: 2796.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: Maybe more people are using GitHub than mailing lists for better and worse.

Segment 768:
Start time: 2796.29
End time: 2798.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: There's it's a lot.

Segment 769:
Start time: 2798.87
End time: 2800.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: I really don't think the process has changed.

Segment 770:
Start time: 2800.32
End time: 2801.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: I'm gonna say like this.

Segment 771:
Start time: 2801.16
End time: 2802.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: It has not changed at all.

Segment 772:
Start time: 2802.92
End time: 2804.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: It's just that more people are aware of it now.

Segment 773:
Start time: 2806.44
End time: 2811.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And with the awareness is bringing more contributors.

Segment 774:
Start time: 2811.39
End time: 2823.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: So there's lots of casual contributors, people that are not going to make a career in software, contributing to software, more tinkering, people that want a thing, but they don't want to wait for the software to come out.

Segment 775:
Start time: 2823.40
End time: 2824.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: Like, let's talk about AI.

Segment 776:
Start time: 2824.68
End time: 2825.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 777:
Start time: 2827.14
End time: 2832.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of people that want to do AI machine learning, people that want to do normal network programming.

Segment 778:
Start time: 2832.39
End time: 2834.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: And they're not the tools aren't out yet.

Segment 779:
Start time: 2834.49
End time: 2836.47

Transcript: The consumer tools are just not there yet.

Segment 780:
Start time: 2836.47
End time: 2846.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: So they have to follow some guide in order to get it to work like that level of engagement is bringing people in that are not, let's say, professional contributors to these type of projects.

Segment 781:
Start time: 2847.56
End time: 2849.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the past, there were a lot more professional contributors.

Segment 782:
Start time: 2849.46
End time: 2851.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: Now there's a lot more casual people.

Segment 783:
Start time: 2851.40
End time: 2856.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: So the people have changed the process, the technology is identical.

Segment 784:
Start time: 2856.07
End time: 2858.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: There's different names we were using.

Segment 787:
Start time: 2866.78
End time: 2867.54

Segment 794:
Start time: 2888.61
End time: 2896.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Segment 806:

Segment 808:
Start time: 2960.21
End time: 2965.12

Segment 809:
Start time: 2965.12
End time: 2969.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 873:

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: This is a technical decision.

Segment 874:
Start time: 3306.49
End time: 3309.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: And basically, the end result is this is what Apple now uses.

Segment 875:
Start time: 3309.19
End time: 3317.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: So this whole magical product that people wanted is now used by the whole world, billions of people, because Apple brought it forward.

Segment 876:
Start time: 3318.10
End time: 3325.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 877:
Start time: 3326.54
End time: 3330.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also have managed to keep a lot of things private.

Segment 878:

End time: 3332.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: But all the ideas were stolen anyway, because they went to Android.

Segment 879:
Start time: 3334.68
End time: 3352.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the second thing, which just happened this year is so many people were thinking, oh, there's another project called GNU Social, which is a new social network based on magical open platforms that are just interoperable and perfect, like email, and not subject to the influences of the powers that be.

Segment 880:
Start time: 3353.94

Segment 882:
Start time: 3368.19
End time: 3375.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 883:
Start time: 3376.74
End time: 3382.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is the open source design and incompatible and all these things.

Segment 884:
Start time: 3382.69
End time: 3387.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 885:
Start time: 3388.54
End time: 3394.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 886:
Start time: 3394.27
End time: 3396.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: And it just happens to be that this is the decade that they came.

Segment 887:
Start time: 3397.74
End time: 3400.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yes, we have been saying it forever.

Segment 888:
Start time: 3400.41
End time: 3404.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: And now we need new goals to aspire to, because the goals that we've been working on have been achieved.

Segment 889:
Start time: 3406.12
End time: 3409.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But no, it does not make businesses obsolete or money obsolete or any of that stuff.

Segment 890:
Start time: 3410.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Segment 893:
Start time: 3423.27
End time: 3428.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Segment 896:
Start time: 3438.74
End time: 3444.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 897:
Start time: 3444.65
End time: 3445.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: I do advisory.

Segment 898:
Start time: 3445.49
End time: 3449.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 899:
Start time: 3449.82
End time: 3450.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: And I make money off of that.

Segment 900:
Start time: 3452.62
End time: 3454.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so it's a nice differentiator.

Segment 901:
Start time: 3454.81
End time: 3459.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: Do you want to have a private conversation where you're going to be paying me or do you want to have a public conversation where I'm going to publish it?

Segment 902:
Start time: 3461.12
End time: 3465.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's a nice differentiator because a lot of people are businesses that don't want to pay for things.

Segment 903:
Start time: 3465.55
End time: 3470.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: So making it public is a really easy way to just differentiate the community world versus the work world.

Segment 904:
Start time: 3472.20
End time: 3476.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And more businesses should just show up and get the advice for free on the call.

Segment 905:
Start time: 3477.80
End time: 3478.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 908:
Start time: 3482.24
End time: 3484.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: The ideas are not special.

Segment 909:
Start time: 3484.69
End time: 3485.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: It's the execution that's special.

Segment 910:
Start time: 3485.77
End time: 3492.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: So for me, it's very nice to separate those two parts of who I talk to, the clients and the private stuff versus the public stuff that I publish.

Segment 911:
Start time: 3497.34
End time: 3501.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 912:
Start time: 3501.41
End time: 3506.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: I mean, I talk to a lot of people and I get quite a bit of DMs that I don't like saying no to people when they want help.

Segment 913:
Start time: 3506.76
End time: 3509.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: If I can help people, especially if it's part of my vision that I'm trying to change the world, I want to help people.

Segment 914:
Start time: 3511.10
End time: 3518.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And putting that into a one hour box each week really helps me clear up my week and stay focused.

Segment 915:
Start time: 3518.10
End time: 3519.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: So that's a very practical thing.

Start time: 3521.36
End time: 3527.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two is it's helping me to make some blog posts, to articulate better some of these ideas.

End time: 3532.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 918:
Start time: 3532.82
End time: 3534.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 919:

Transcript:  Something people don't understand.

Segment 920:
Start time: 3537.76
End time: 3542.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 921:
Start time: 3542.43
End time: 3544.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript: And that is the word on the subject.

Segment 922:
Start time: 3544.45
End time: 3548.40

Segment 923:
Start time: 3548.40
End time: 3549.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 3551.22
End time: 3559.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 925:
Start time: 3559.23
End time: 3560.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 3567.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Segment 935:
